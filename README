Post Installation

To run the report: http://server:port/Rhythmyx/rxs_ConfigReport_cas/full_report.html


To configure Shared Fields:
Using the Percussion Workbench,

In the XML Server View / Applications / open rxs_ConfigReport_cas and find the application_report query resource.

Open the mapper and make sure there is an entry for each shared field file you have.

The name of the element is not important but remember it for the next stage.

You can remove any that are not needed.
     DevRxMaster_RXDUAL/SHARED maps to the rxs_ct_shared.xml file.

Keep the SYSTEM and CE entries.

It does not matter if you have extras here.

View the exits on the application_report query resource.  Make sure
there is one and only one sys_xdFileToTree exit for each shared field file (not group) that
exists on the server.  (SYSTEM and CE should also exist).  

The fileName parameter should be specified as rxconfig\Server\ContentEditors\shared\{the filename}.xml
The destinationNode is the node you created in the mapper.

Make sure you remove any that do not exist on your implementation.  e.g. DEMO, JUMPSTART, NWI_SHARED, RSS

On the Rhythmyx Server, Modify the <RxRoot>/sys_wfPreviewWorkflow/previewworkflow.xsl.  Add an output method to the xsl:stylesheet node as follows:

<xsl:stylesheet version="1.1" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" exclude-result-prefixes="psxi18n" xmlns:psxi18n="urn:www.percussion.com/i18n" >
<xsl:output method="xml"/>  <!-- this line is added for the Config report to display the Workflows correctly. -->
<xsl:variable name="this" select="/"/>
<xsl:template match="/">
